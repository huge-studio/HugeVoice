## Safari/iOS Testing Considerations 🍎

When implementing step definitions for Safari/iOS compatibility:

1. **Browser Detection Testing**: Test Safari/iOS detection logic
2. **Audio Context Testing**: Mock Web Audio API with Safari-specific behavior
3. **User Interaction Testing**: Simulate tap/click events required by Safari
4. **Buffer Size Testing**: Verify different buffer sizes are used for Safari
5. **Audio Queueing Testing**: Test audio queuing when context not ready
6. **Silent Buffer Testing**: Verify silent audio unlocking technique
7. **Device-Specific Testing**: Test with iOS Safari, desktop Safari
8. **Integration Testing**: Test with real Safari instances when possible

## Implementation Notes

The step definitions are currently marked with `throw new PendingStepException()` and need to be implemented based on your testing strategy. Consider:

1. **Test Infrastructure**: Set up TestServer for integration tests
2. **Browser Automation**: Configure Selenium for UI tests with Safari support
3. **SignalR Testing**: Mock or test SignalR connections and new validation methods
4. **Audio Testing**: Mock audio APIs or use test audio files with Safari-specific behavior
5. **Multi-user Scenarios**: Implement concurrent user simulation
6. **Channel Persistence Testing**: Test broadcaster disconnection and reconnection scenarios
7. **Validation Layer Testing**: Test each validation layer independently and together
8. **Race Condition Testing**: Test concurrent broadcaster requests
9. **UI Testing**: Test new channel status display and real-time updates
10. **Logging Testing**: Verify comprehensive logging and debug information
11. **Safari Testing**: Test Safari-specific audio handling and optimizations
